True Purpose of the Study: This study examined how people perceive gradual changes when information is presented sequentially over time. We were specifically testing the "boiling frog" effect — the idea that people have difficulty noticing problems that develop gradually. We compared whether binary data (lake freeze: yes/no) versus continuous data (temperature numbers) helps people better detect gradual warming trends.

Why we didn't fully explain this beforehand: Knowing the true purpose might have influenced how you viewed the data, which could have affected the validity of our results.

What we measured: Your perceptions of climate impact, warming, and change detection in the fictional town of Townsville.

Questions or concerns: If you have any questions about this study, please contact Prof. Rachit Dubey at rdubey@ucla.edu.
