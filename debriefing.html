    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;">True Purpose of the Study</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        This study examined how people perceive gradual changes when information is presented sequentially over time. 
        We were specifically testing the "boiling frog" effect — the idea that people have difficulty noticing problems 
        that develop gradually. We compared whether binary data (lake freeze: yes/no) versus continuous data (temperature numbers) 
        helps people better detect gradual warming trends.

    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;">Why We Didn't Fully Explain This Beforehand</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Knowing the true purpose might have influenced how you viewed the data, which could have affected the validity of our results.
