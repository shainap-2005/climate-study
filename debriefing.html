  <h2>Study Title: Data Perception Study</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>True Purpose of the Study:</strong>  
    This study examined how people perceive gradual changes when information is presented sequentially over time.
    We were specifically testing the "boiling frog" effect — the idea that people have difficulty noticing problems
    that develop gradually. We compared whether binary data (lake freeze: yes/no) versus continuous data
    (temperature numbers) helps people better detect gradual warming trends.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Why we didn’t fully explain this beforehand:</strong>  
    Knowing the true purpose might have influenced how you viewed the data, which could have affected the validity of our results.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>What we measured:</strong>  
    Your perceptions of climate impact, warming, and change detection in the fictional town of Townsville.
  </p>
